# Topic 3 Operating system security - filesystems and windows

## Learning objectives

- Describe the features of a typical operating system, with specific details about the Windows system
- Explain the core functionality of a filesystem and why it needs to be secure
- Identify security features and flaws of contemporary and historical versions of Windows operating systems

## Operating systems: windows and OS hardening

- The operating system (OS) manages computer hardware resources and provides services to competing programs.
- OS security involves ensuring integrity, confidentiality, and availability.
- OS protection refers to measures used to protect the OS from intruders or attacks.
- Modern systems are globally accessible through the internet, creating security risks.
- Microsoft Windows 10 is the most commonly used desktop OS worldwide.
- Key components of a secure OS include the kernel, security kernel, reference monitor, and trusted computing base.
- Windows OS components for security include security reference monitor, local security authority, security account manager, active directory, WinLogon, and NetLogon.
- Common client-side vulnerabilities in the OS are found in web browsers, office software (e.g., Microsoft Office), and email clients.
- Hardening the system before deployment involves actions such as network configuration, patch installation, file removal, BIOS password protection, and disabling unnecessary devices.
- Measures to secure Windows OS include disabling automatic login, requiring credentials to exit screensaver, enabling system security, disabling unnecessary wireless connections, using protective antivirus software, managing updates, establishing backups, enabling authentication, creating user profiles, and setting an admin/root password.

## File system and directory structure

- A file is a collection of linked data stored on secondary or non-volatile memory.
- The file system in an operating system is used to store, retrieve, and manage files on the disk.
- Commonly used file systems include FAT32, exFAT, NTFS (Windows), HFS+ or APFS (Mac), X-23 or X4 (Linux), UFS, ZFS (Unix).
- Files are saved on disks and retain their data even when a user logs off.
- File attributes include name, position, type, size, protection, time, date, and safety.
- The file system includes the directory structure, which contains information about files associated with directories.
- Directories allow users to assign appropriate titles to files and access both their own files and files generated by other users.
- Directory structure elements include filename, type, location information, protection information, and flags indicating the type of entry (directory, link, installed file format).
- The directory also stores miscellaneous data such as creation and update dates.
- The lecture provided an overview of file systems and directory structures, and the next lecture will cover methods for securing a file system.
