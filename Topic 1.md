## Reading

[Ethics in Information Security](./Readings/Ethics%20in%20Information%20Security.pdf)

## Learning objectives

- Understand the central goals and aspects of computer security
- Understand and explain the differences between a range of malware types
- Be able to identify key examples of malware and their historical significance

## What is Computer Security

> Protecting computer related assets against an attacker or threat, as well as ensuring the secure usage of computer hardware and software by non attacker.

### Goals

1. **Prevention**: safeguarding assets from threats
2. **Protection**: having systems to tell you the attack or malicious activity is or about to take place
3. **Reaction**: defining the procedures that enable you to deal with an attack

### Aspects

1. **Policy**: deals with confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
2. **Threat model**: the set of assumptions about the people involved in malicious activity
3. **Mechanism**: the software or hardware that's designed and implemented to make sure the policies enforced using assumptions we made with the threat model

### Terms

- **Attack**: activities harmful to computer systems, data, software and hardware, etc
- **Risk**: the possibility of damage or loss of digital assets in case of an attack
- **Zero-day vulnerability**: a vulnerability used by an attacker before being discovered by the developer of the software. 
    - **zero-day**: the length of time the developer has to react to this particular issue (non at all)
- **Exploit**: the software used to take advantage of a bug or vulnerability
- **Hacker**: 
    - **white hats**: aka. Ethical Hackers. Try to find (and fix) weaknesses in the computer or network system with proper permission from a company
    - **black hats**: Try to penetrate the system to gain unauthorized access. (harm, steal)
    - **gray hats**: working with varying combinations of good and bad intentions.

## Types of malicious software

> **Malware**: a peace of software designed to disrupt, damage, and distroy the normal functionality of an information system.

- **viruses**: sharing key characteristics with their biological counterparts.They self-replicate by inserting themselves into other files, programs, documents, etc. Easily spread through dodgy emails, USB sticks, and downloads from untrustworthy sources.
    - *creeper*: one of the first computer viruses (1971)

- **worms**: can replicate itself without attaching to any existing software.
    - *stuxnet*: one of the most destructive worms

- **adware**: displays advertisements on your screen, one of the most visible form of malware, purpose is to collect user's data.
    - *viable*: a well-known adware, infected almost 250 million computers/devices in 2017

- **Trojans**: (named after the famous ancient Greek tale) hide themselves inside an application or program data and spread based on specific user action.
    - *Trojan Zeus* had infected 1 million user accounts and compromised thousands of FTP, email and bank accounts belonging to large enterprises (2010)

- **Spyware**: spy on the target machine or user, collects information and send it back to the hacker for further use or for sale on the dark web
    - *dark hotel spyware*: use hotel WiFi to target the personal systems of government officials, business typcoons and political leaders

- **keyloggers**: records every keystroke.
    - *Olympic Vision*: launch business email compromise or BEC attacks on businessman in the US, Middle East, and Asia.

- **Ransomware**: victim data is encrypted, backup files are deleted, and demand money for decription. 
    - *WannaCry*: Exploited vulnerabilities in older Windows systems (2017 May)

- **Botnets**: computers connecting to the internet are infected without the user realizing, a distributed denial of service attack (DDoS attack) will be launched, where a website/web service collapsed when flooded with too many information.
    - *Ecobot*: used to exploit over 50 known vulnerbilities, infects a wide range of IoT connected devices.

- **rookits**: remain hidden on the target computer and activate in secret. Giving cybercriminals remote access, stealing confidential information, launch the previously mentioned attacks etc.
    - *Zacinlo rootkit*: downloaded within a fake VPN app, opens a browser and interact with it like a human, the browser will open the back door to the comprimise system, which the hacker can then launch attacks.
