# Peer-graded Assignment: Mitigating risk and securing systems

## The laptop thieves

You are chief security officer for your local branch of an international consulting firm. Your consultants spend a lot of their time visiting client offices all over the country and also internationally. When they are on a client visit, they need to be able to access sensitive company and client information from their laptops, either stored locally or on your company servers.  

There have been reports of bands of thieves operating on the local public transport system, targeting peopleâ€™s laptop bags. Your CEO has heard about this and is concerned that the thieves are not simply looking for laptop hardware, but working with cybercriminals to steal valuable data.  

She has asked you to write a report on possible responses to this risk and, in particular, to identify and describe some threat and defence mechanisms.

## Review criteria

You should answer the questions in terms of what you have learned in the course so far.

## Questions

### Describe the three most dangerous attacks that could happen if a cybercriminal gains access to a company laptop

1. Data Theft: One of the most dangerous attacks that could occur if a cybercriminal gains access to a company laptop is data theft. The attacker could extract sensitive and valuable company and client information stored on the laptop. This can include intellectual property, financial data, customer information, or trade secrets. The stolen data can be used for various malicious purposes, such as selling it on the dark web, conducting identity theft, or leveraging it for competitive advantage.

2. Unauthorized Access: If a cybercriminal gains access to a company laptop, they can exploit the opportunity to gain unauthorized access to the organization's network and systems. They can use the laptop as a foothold to explore the network, escalate privileges, and launch further attacks. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation of systems, planting of malware or backdoors, and compromise of critical infrastructure.

3. Malware Infection: Another dangerous attack that can occur is the installation of malware on the company laptop. Cybercriminals can introduce various types of malware, such as keyloggers, spyware, ransomware, or remote access trojans (RATs). These malicious programs can operate stealthily in the background, capturing sensitive information, monitoring user activities, or even taking control of the laptop remotely. Malware infections can result in data loss, financial losses, system disruptions, and reputational damage.

### Describe the three highest priority defenses to put in place to ensure that the company remains secure if a laptop is stolen

1. Full Disk Encryption: Implementing full disk encryption is a critical defense measure to protect the data stored on company laptops. By encrypting the entire hard drive, even if the laptop is stolen, the data remains inaccessible without the encryption key. This ensures that even if the thief attempts to bypass authentication or access the data directly, they will be unable to retrieve any valuable information.

2. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, such as MFA, adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access to company systems and data. MFA requires users to provide multiple factors for authentication, such as something they know (password), something they have (smart card or token), or something they are (biometric data). This makes it significantly harder for cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access even if they possess a stolen laptop.

3. Remote Wipe and Device Tracking: Implementing a remote wipe capability allows the company to remotely erase the data on a stolen laptop, rendering it useless to the thief. Additionally, having a device tracking system in place enables the organization to locate the stolen laptop and assist law enforcement in its recovery. These measures help mitigate the risk of data exposure and increase the chances of recovering the stolen device.

It's important to note that while these defenses are essential, a comprehensive security strategy should also include regular data backups, strong password policies, up-to-date security patches, employee awareness training, and robust network security measures to protect against potential threats beyond the laptop theft scenario.
