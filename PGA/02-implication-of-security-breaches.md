# Practice Peer-graded Assignment: Implications of security breaches – batten down the hatches

As you have learned in this section of the course, network security is a collection of policies and practices to prevent and protect against unauthorised intrusion into networks. Despite the high security standards adopted by companies and organisations over the years, there has been a history of attacks which partially, if not completely, took down valuable services and disrupted people's lives.

In 2011, Sony experienced a Playstation Network outage as a result of an attack on Sony’s services. The attack resulted in approximately 77 million accounts being compromised. Users of Playstation 3 consoles could no longer access their services and some of their account details were exposed to the attackers. Sony was forced to turn off the Playstation Network service in what was one of the largest data security breaches in history.

Sony reassured customers that credit cards details were encrypted but also admitted that other confidential details were at risk of exposure. Services were slowly restored after the attack as Sony strengthened its services and it continues to do so today. One example is the two-step verification feature introduced in 2016.

Write a report regarding a significant historical network security outage which disrupted individuals’ lives or a company’s reputation. In particular, identify and describe features of the attack, including implications and lessons learned regarding said attack.

> A good example answer might cover something similar to the description of the Playstation Network outage used in this exercise introduction. Answers should clearly explore a scenario in relation to a number of relevant points.

1. Based on your research, describe the overall **scenario** and the **consequences** of the outage.



2. Define the **importance** of **confidentiality**, **integrity** and **availability** in such as scenario.



3. Describe the **state** of security of the system **before** the attack and the steps taken **following** the attack.



4. Suggest what could have been used to **prevent** the attack or to **minimise** the **impact** of the attack.
